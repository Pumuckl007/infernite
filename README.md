This mod adds a way to double your diamonds once in the nether by making it so you can create infernal alloys two per diamond.
Once you have gone to the nether you probably don't want to have to look for lots of diamonds this mod allows you to make Infernite Ingots  smelt them into Melted Infernite Ingots  Then combined with a diamond to make Melted Infernite alloy  which can be smelted into Infernite Alloy .

Infernite Ingots and Infernite Alloys Can be crafted into tools and Infernite Ingots can be craft into armor too.
